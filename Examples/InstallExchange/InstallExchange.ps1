                This is added so that AppVeyor automatic tests can pass, otherwise
                the tests will fail on passwords being in plain text and not being
                encrypted. Because it is not possible to have a certificate in
                AppVeyor to encrypt the passwords we need to add the parameter
                'PSDscAllowPlainTextPassword'.
